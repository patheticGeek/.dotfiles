## Geek's dotfiles

### Installation

1. Whichever platform you are on make sure you have `stow` and `git`
2. Clone this repo in home dir
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/patheticGeek/.dotfiles
    ```
3. Run the install script
    ```
    cd ~/.dotfiles
    ./install.sh
    ```
    To install with personal (its a private git repo)
    ```
    cd ~/.dotfiles
    PERSONAL=true ./install.sh
    ```

### Some explanation

I'm using _stow_ to manage the symlinks.

This is inspired by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUllCAGs3c

Each folder in this repo will have its contents (files and folders) placed as symlink in the home dir.

So if i have a file and folder such as `zsh/.zshrc`, `zsh/.oh-my-zsh/custom`

and then run `stow zsh` it will create symlinks at `~/.zshrc` and `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom`.

The `personal` folder is a submodule, it is a private repo where i have my _personal_ keys and stuff.

### How to add more stuff

1. Create a folder in `~/.dotfiles`
    ```
    mkdir ~/.dotfiles/vim
    ```
2. Move the files related to that in the folder
    ```
    mv ~/.vimrc ~/.dotfiles/vim/
    ```
3. Then create the symlink with stow
    ```
    stow vim
    ```

âœ¨ And you're done
